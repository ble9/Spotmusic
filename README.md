#**SpotMusic** 


SpotMusic is a React App that uses two APIs: the spotify web api to connect to spotify and make calls to the api and unsplash to randomly select the backgrounds. 
**you need to have spotify web player running first**


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#**Possible future direction of project**


##`intergrate the playbackbuttons, with optimizing the loadtimes for unsplash images` 
- add in next,previous, play,pause buttons
- convert app to include some type of grouping for people to add to list

##`IoT smart mirror project`
-  won't need to add in playback buttons but will have to do more configurations
